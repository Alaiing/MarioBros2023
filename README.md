Re-creation of Mario Bros. from the Nintendo Entertainment System (1986)

Made live on https://www.twitch.tv/alaiing

Rules : 
- I only re-create a vertical slice of the original game (only the core gameplay and a couple levels)
- it's not an emulation thing, I only re-create gameplay
- sprites were found there : https://www.spriters-resource.com/ (or sometimes ripped from screenshots from an emulator)
- musics and sounds are re-made with my mouth ðŸ˜®

Made using MonoGame (https://monogame.net/)

Since it's mostly made live (I very rarely code offline) the code can be a bit unstructured, with lots of quick and dirty bits. In other words: it's not in any way an example of how to code a game ðŸ˜…. DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME.
